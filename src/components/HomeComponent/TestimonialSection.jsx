                which made it very convenient to the staffs. What makes a franchise impressive is 
                that they are helping other people to enrich their lives. 
                The head office as well as the area supervisor are present to give their support 
                especially now that we are currently experiencing a pandemic, they give advises 
                and tips that helped us in this kind of situation. I am more than happy to be a 
                franchisee owner of LT&G, I can say that youâ€™re safe in hands."</h4>
